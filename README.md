# Co-Worker Appreciation App Template

| [Overview](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-apps-coworker-appreciation/wiki) | [Deployment guide](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-apps-coworker-appreciation/wiki/Deployment-Guide) | [Architecture](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-apps-coworker-appreciation/wiki/Architecture) |

Using the co-worker appreciation template in Microsoft teams, users can recognize their colleague's achievements right within the Teams' context. WHen they can click to reward a colleague, recipients and other team members are notified about the award details in the channel by tagging them in a channel conversation. 

The awards are recorded in the team app which is secure, portable and easily shareable.

This can be considered as the PowerApps based, leader-board version of the Open Badges app template.
